    "I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning, under the supervision of Stanley Durrleman and Stéphanie Allassonnière.
    Ecole Polytechnique (CMAP) and Brain and Spine Institute (@ Pitié Salpétrière hospital). My thesis aims at developing Machine Learning tools to investigate neurodegenerative processes and dynamics",
    "Using my mathematical and coding skills to create impact where it matters.
    Beyond medical application, I love to develop tools or share my knowledge in many applications to help people achieve their goals, as long as they involve motivating & positive impacts. This includes various projects from a chatbot for a Social-and-Solidarity association to a web-app to choose and analyze the different political parties at the French election through teaching at University or a Data Science Summer School.",
    "Learning and keeping an open mind to innovative ideas, framework, tools.
    Because I would like to be as proficient as possible, I try to stay tuned about the innovations and researches that might impact my working areas."
