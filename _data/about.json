    "I graduated from Centrale-Sup√©lec and I did a MSc in Microengineering at EPFL, and then decided to focus on Artifical Intelligence. I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in my final internship in Japan.",
    "After coming back in France, I spent some time as a Data Science consultant, and I'm currently working in the AI team at Scaleway. I work on several projects including infrastructure (GPU Instances) and proper AI projects for internal or external purposes (See the <a href='projects'>Projects</a> page for the ones I spoke about publically).",
    "In my free time, I like to travel, take <a href='https://500px.com/duanradlaw'>nice photographs</a> of said travels and I'm also taking night courses learning Japanese at the <a href='http://www.inalco.fr'>INALCO</a>."
